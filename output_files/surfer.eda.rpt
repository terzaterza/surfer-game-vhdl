    Info: Version 18.1.0 Build 625 09/12/2018 SJ Lite Edition
    Info: Processing started: Tue Dec 20 20:35:52 2022
Info: Command: quartus_eda --read_settings_files=on --write_settings_files=off surfer -c surfer --gen_testbench
Info (119006): Selected device 5CSEMA5F31C6 for design "surfer"
Warning (21300): LOCKED port on the PLL is not properly connected on instance "pll:PLL_I|pll_0002:pll_inst|altera_pll:altera_pll_i|general[0].gpll". The LOCKED port on the PLL should be connected when the FBOUTCLK port is connected. Although it is unnecessary to connect the LOCKED signal, any logic driven off of an output clock of the PLL will not know when the PLL is locked and ready.
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
